#Laboratory project - Reliable Data Transmission over an Unreliable Network with the FT20 Protocol

# Goal

This assignment concerns the problem of delivering information reliably across a network where a degree of packet loss is expected. 

The goal is to understand how the performance of sliding window protocols is impacted by parameter choices, such as fixed timeouts, adaptative timeouts, windows sizes, as well as the flow control technique employed etc.

# Context

This assignment will use a simple file transfer protocol, between a client and a server, implemented in the CNSS simulator. 

# FT20 Protocol

The FT20 protocol, developed for this assignment, allows for the reliable transfer of a file from a client to a server, over an unreliable network. This protocol comprises a total of 5 types of packets, namely `UPLOAD`, `ERROR`, `DATA`, `ACK` and `FIN`. 

## FT20 Packets

Each packet type is identified by an 1-byte numeric *opcode*. The format and purpose of each packet is as follows:

* ***UPLOAD***

  `|1|timestamp|filename|`

  Initiates the transfer of the file with the given `filename. This packet has 0 as its implicit *sequence number*.
  
* ***ERROR***

  `|2|errormessage|`

  Reports a fatal error.

* ***DATA***

  `|3|timestamp|seqN|data|`

  Represents a block of file data. The block is identified by a *sequence number* (`seqNÂ´), starting at 1, for the first block of a file.

  `data` - the file block payload encoded as raw bytes. 

* ***ACK***

  `|4|timestamp|cSeqN|sSeqN|`

  Confirms correctly received packets.

  `cSeqN` - Represents a **cumulative sequence number** that acknowledges **all** packets up to and including the given value.

  `sSeqN` - Acknowledges the **given** packet, identified by this `sSeqN` value. A value of ***-1** means this field is *invalid/not present*. 

* ***FIN***

  `|5|timestamp|seqN|`

  Signals the file transfer is complete. The sequence number (`seqN`) should be 1 past the last block of the file.

When present, the `timestamp` field is expected to contain the time the packet was sent. For ACK packets, the `timestamp` is obtained/copied from the packet that generated that ACK packet. Used in this way, the `timestamp` can be used to sample  the RTT between the client and server nodes.

The Cumulative Sequence Numbers issued by the server support the **Go back N** (GBN) version of the sliding window protocol. Selective Sequence Numbers can be used to support the **Selective Repeat** version of the same protocol.

## FT20 File Transfer 

The figure below illustrates the packet exchange between the client and server, using the `Stop&Wait` protocol.
![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSrnzM0E_KnSi9R5NW1GReXt9IjW36o7kT3oS-JgOPn2Hhigy3iyA40xRlo2IYvQpmegOvx6RpFfg1y/pub?w=509&h=539)

To achieve a reliable file transfer, `UPLOAD`, `DATA` and `FIN` packets are retransmitted until acknowledged by the server.

## CNSS Simulation 

### FT20 Packets
To implement the FT20 Protocol in CNSS, we require a way to encode FT20 packets as CNSS data packets. 

[FT20Packet.java](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/ft20/FT20Packet.java) is a Java class to encode FT20Packets into arrays of bytes, which can be used as the payloads of CNSS [DataPackets](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/cnss/blob/master/src/cnss/simulator/DataPacket.java). Conversely, the same class allows an array of bytes to be decoded into an FT20Packet. The only relevant public methods are `encodeToBytes()` and `decodeFromBytes()`.

Companion classes: [FT20_UploadPacket](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/ft20/FT20_UploadPacket.java), [FT20_DataPacket](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/ft20/FT20_DataPacket.java), [FT20_AckPacket](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/ft20/FT20_AckPacket.java), [FT20_FinPacket](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/ft20/FT20_FinPacket.java), [FT20_ErrorPacket](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/ft20/FT20_ErrorPacket.java) model each specific FT20 packet type. These classes expose FT20 Packet fields as public **immutable** data. In these classes, the public constructors is the only way to assemble new FT20 packets.

The box below reproduces the [FT20_UploadPacket](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/ft20/FT20_UploadPacket.java) class, which models the UPLOAD packet.



```
%%writefile src/ft20/FT20_UploadPacket.java

package ft20;

public class FT20_UploadPacket extends FT20Packet {
        public int timestamp;
        public final String filename;

        FT20_UploadPacket(byte[] payload) {
                super(payload);
                this.timestamp = super.getInt();
                this.filename = super.getString();
        }

        public FT20_UploadPacket(String filename, int timestamp) {
                super(UPLOAD);
                this.timestamp = timestamp;
                this.filename = filename;
                super.putInt(timestamp).putString(filename);
        }

        public String toString() {
                return String.format("UPLOAD<%s, %d>", filename, timestamp);
        }
}
```

### FT20 Nodes

The *client* and *server* nodes of the FT20 protocol can be implemented in CNSS directly on top of the [ApplicationAlgorithm](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/cnss/blob/master/src/cnss/simulator/ApplicationAlgorithm.java) or [AbstractApplicationAlgorithm](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/cnss/blob/master/src/cnss/lib/AbstractApplicationAlgorithm.java) classes.

Alternatively, the client and server nodes can extend the [FT20AbstractApplication](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/ft20/FT20AbstractApplication.java) class. This way, the handling of FT20 packets is greatly simplified. Namely, this class uses the [FT20_PacketHandler](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/ft20/FT20_PacketHandler.java) interface to provide specific *upcalls* for each of the FT20 packet types.

# Assignment-2 Deliverables

There are three deliverables:
* Delivery 1: GoBackN: MANDATORY, evaluation up to 15 marks

* Delivery 2: Selective Repeat: OPTIONAL, evaluation up to 3 marks

* Delivery 3: Adaptative Timeouts, either for GoBackN or for Selective Repeat, evaluation up to 2 marks


*IMPORTANT: study chapter 6 of the book supporting the course to fully understand these protocols.*

## First Deliverable - GoBackN

Implement the sliding window version of the FT20Protocol, using the **GoBackN** technique.

Your *client* should be implemented in a class named `FT20ClientGBN`. It has to accept 3 arguments, in this order:

`filename` - the file being transferred;

`blocksize` - the size of file blocks sent in each `DATA` packet;

`windowsize` - the capacity of the window in number of blocks.

For tests use the provided server FT20Server. Your client should work correctly with the provided server. You must ***not change*** the server in any way. 

Use a fixed, default timeout value of 1000 ms.

Watch out for corner cases, such as: files that fit in a single block, files with length that is whole multiple of the blocksize.

Test your implementation against configurations [config-2.1](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/configs/config-2.1.txt) [config-2.2](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/configs/config-2.2.txt) [config-2.3](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/configs/config-2.3.txt)

Your solution should be as general as possible. It will be tested against a variety of configurations in addition to those provided.

Confirm the transfered file is identical to the original. You can use the `diff` command for that.

***Important Notes*** 
* Look at the implementation constraints at the end of this notebook. Violating them will penalize your final evaluation.
* If you only implement this deliverable, your work evaluation will be at most 15 marks.


## Optative Deliverable - Selective Repeat.

Improve your previous delivery by using the techniques introduced by the **Selective Repeat** version of the protocol. 

Your *client* should be implemented in a class named `FT20ClientSR`.

Use a fixed default timeout value of 1000 ms.

Leverage the `sSeqN` field present in `ACK` packets to selectively retransmit expired packets.

Using the provided configuration files, compare the results of this version against those for the GBN version of the first deliverable.

Also test your implementation against configuration [config-2.4](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/configs/config-2.4.txt)

***Important Notes*** 
* Look at the implementation constraints at the end of this notebook. Violating them will penalize your final evaluation.
* If you implement this optative deliverable, your work evaluation can be increased by up to 3 marks.

## Optative Deliverable - Adaptative timeout

You can leverage the `timestamp` field present in most packets to estimate RTT and improve the performance of your best solution (the GBN one if you have not implemented the SR one, or the SR one if you have implemented it) using an adaptative timeout.

Your *client* should be implemented in a class named `FT20ClientGBN_DT` or `FT20ClientSR_DT` depending on your best solution.

The fixed timeout value used in the previous solutions should be replaced by a dynamic value based on an estimate of the network RTT between client and server. 

*IMPORTANT: please study section 7.2 of the book supporting the course for more information on TCP dynamic
timeouts which you may use as inspiration*

Compare the results of this version against those for the fixed timeout versions of the previous deliverables, using the provided configuration files.

***Important Note*** 
* If you implement this optative improvement, your work evaluation can be be increased by up to 2 marks.


## Statistics

A statistics report should be presented at the end of each file transfer. 

Refer to the provided reference Stop&Wait version [FT20ClientSW](https://github.com/jlegatheaux/RC2020-assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/src/FT20ClientSW.java) to see how to produce the statistics report.

## Implementation Constraints

You **must not change** the provided **FT20_* classes** in any way. Note that for evaluation purposes, your code will be tested against the **original** versions of the files.

You are only allowed to send 1 packet, on each 1 ms `on_clock_tick` round. Retransmitting *expired packets* takes priority compared to sending fresh packets added to the sliding window. In other words, *older packets* take
priority. 

You cannot send `DATA` packets in the `on_timeout` upcall. `UPLOAD` and `FIN` packets are allowed.
